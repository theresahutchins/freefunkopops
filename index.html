                I like when bugs choose me. It is such a simple thing that for some reason to me, feels like everything. The two dragonflies that wouldn't go near my brother but took a nap on my knee. The sleepy bee at the Pirate's game that fell asleep on my leg (next to the bee tattoo, nonetheless). They have such short lifespans and decide to use me as a rest spot and I do think it is special. They have never hurt me during their time here either. Why be scared or shoo them away. I would never. What if the earth shooed me away? Blashphemy.

                <h3>Tues Jul 30 2024</h3>
			I feel super evil today. I have not been evil in a while so I guess that is fun. Evil mode on. It was onset by a slight of rain mixed with getting away with things I shouldnt. Lalalala! Been listening to a lot of goth tunes while I code with a fairy floss theme. COding in R though so its psuedo coding essentially. I can't work on this in public becausew html is so embarassing so I gotta do it quick while no one is around. Been reading books (right now we have 6 half done- this is bad) but they all claim to be disturbing. I think normies glorify and make drug users into something they arent and dehumanize them to a point where it's normal for them to become a sort of twisted narrative in fiction meant to shock in a edgy way which is sooo weird. Like that one movie where they get into heroin and stuff but indie kids love it for the editing and saw type lighting aesthetics just makes me bite my toungue idk. Whats that movie called. Requim for da dream. Jared Leto hot as hell in it so fair enough.its like u never saw an OD and it shows mama

My manager slapped my back while I had my headphones on and it scared me and i yelled. I got a present. I really fw taco bell. I am considering picking up a bad habit. I need to scream at it. I need to jump into water from a tall height. I won gun game with a lead of 9 which was goated. Adromeda just came on I feel a little better. Nothing in it for me except a heart thats lazy.. running from my own life now... looking up to the sky for something I may never find. Coffee date w DDog in the morning booyah.

<img id="albsl" src="bossanova.jpeg">
<p>I love the pixies. Anything they make is rightfully stuck in my head perpetually. I think I put off their entire discigraphy for a while due to Where is My Mind? being cringe. But yeah objectively that song doesn't do them justice. </p>
<p>Tracklist: 1. Cecilia Ann 2:06, 2. Rock Music 1:52, 3. Velouria 3:40, 4. Allison 1:18, 5. Is She Weird 3:01, 6. Ana 2:09, 7. All Over the World 5:27, 8. Dig for Fire 3:03, 9. Down to the Well 2:29, 10. The Happening 4:19, 11. Blown Away 2:20, 12. Hang Wire 2:01, 13. Stormy Weather 3:27, 14. Havalina 2:34</p>

<h2 style="text-align: right;">TURN ON THE BRIGHT LIGHTS - INTERPOL</h2>
<img id="albs" src="totbl.jpeg">
<p> This album will be a top ten for me perpetually. It is Interpol's debut studio album. I have the name of it tattoed on my knee. Every song is a banger. Their entire discography is a banger. This is the first album I heard by them and it changed my life from start to finish. Released August 20, 2002. This album made me read Meet Me in the Bathroom which describes their creation and growth since starting in NYU in 1998. Matador Records. 

Tracklist: 1. Untitled, 2. Obstacle 1, 3. NYC, 4. PDA, 5. Say Hello to the Angels, 6. Hands Away, 7. Obstacle 2, 8. Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down, 9. Roland, 10. The New, 11. Leif Erikson

<h2 style="text-align: left;">THE NEW ABNORMAL - THE STROKES</h2>
<img id="albsl" src="newab.jpeg">
<p>The Stroke's newest album, The New Abnormal is a perfect extension of all of their prior albums. Perhaps even better which is not something we see out of bands this late in their carreers. Cover artwork by Basquait is also super cool (fact checkt this). Also big NY 2000s scene, the Strokes and their rise to being goated is also documented in Meet Me in the Bathroom. Not a single non-banger detected even after critical surveilance. Can someone explain why they went back to RCA? The book was written prior to this.

Tracklist: 1. The Adults Are Talking, 2. Selfless, 3. Brooklyn Bridge To Chorus, 4. Bad Decisions, 5. Eternal Summer, 6. At The Door, 7. Why Are Sundays So Depressing, 8. Not The Same Anymore, 9. Ode To The Mets

<p>Hurrian Hymn No. 6
But for the title of oldest extant song, most historians point to “Hurrian Hymn No. 6,” an ode to the goddess Nikkal that was composed in cuneiform by the ancient Hurrians sometime around the 14th century B.C.

The clay tablets containing the tune were excavated in the 1950s from the ruins of the city of Ugarit in Syria. Along with a near-complete set of musical notations, they also include specific instructions for how to play the song on a type of nine-stringed lyre.

“Hurrian Hymn No. 6” is considered the world’s earliest melody, but the oldest musical composition to have survived in its entirety is a first century A.D. Greek tune known as the “Seikilos Epitaph.” The song was found engraved on an ancient marble column used to mark a woman’s gravesite in Turkey.
